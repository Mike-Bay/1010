# Security Risk Assessment Report

After inspecting the organization’s network, we discovered four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:

1. The organization’s employees casually share passwords.
2. The admin password for the database is set to the default.
3. The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
4. Multifactor authentication (MFA) was not used.

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future.

Here is a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and to explain what methods can be used to further secure the network :

## Part 1: Selecting up to Three Hardening Tools and Methods to Implement :

1. Password policies
2. Firewall maintenance
3. Multifactor authentication (MFA)

## Part 2: My Recommendations :

During the inspection of the network, it was discovered that there are several loopholes that reduce the security posture and expand the attack surface of the organization. Examples include employees sharing passwords and the admin’s password for the database being set to default. This can still be exploited in potential future attacks. To mitigate this, enforce stronger encryption password policies by using salt and hash methods to prevent attackers from easily guessing user passwords and require all employees to use Multifactor Authentication (MFA) to help protect against brute force attacks. Another issue found during the investigation of the breach was that firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
